    `.env` holds a real BOT_TOKEN, and `bot.main.send_admin_message` falls back
    to the HTTP Bot API whenever no Application is running — which is every
    test process. So a test that deliberately fails warehouse validation, as
    the cell-guard tests must, sent a real alert to real admins:

        ⚠️ Warehouse validation failed — full retry scheduled (attempt 1/3).
        rows=2→2 (match=True), cells: 1 missing/0 orphaned, revenue=1000.00

    Two orders and a thousand hryvnia — unmistakably a fixture, delivered to a
    phone at midday. Individual tests stubbing `_send_warehouse_alert` is not
    protection; it only covers the paths someone remembered.

    Autouse and function-scoped, so a test that wants to exercise delivery can
    still patch the same name itself and see its own mock.

    `DuckDBStore()` with no argument opens DB_PATH, and `get_store()` — which
    every route reaches through Depends — builds exactly that. So a single
    `TestClient(app)` request was enough: tests/integration/test_internal_sales_type.py
    opened the 8.7 GB production file on every run, and the only reason it did
    no damage is that this machine holds a copy rather than the live one. On a
    host where data/ is the real volume, running the suite would have opened
    the database the bot and the web container are using.

    Redirecting DB_PATH is only possible because __init__ resolves it at call
    time; it used to be a default argument, frozen at import.

    Function-scoped against tmp_path, so each test gets an empty database and
    none of them can see another's writes. A test that wants a specific file
    still passes db_path= explicitly and is unaffected.
